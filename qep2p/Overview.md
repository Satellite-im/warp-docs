# Quantum Entanglement P2P

Quantum Entanglement P2P is an RTC layer that allows communications between multiple parties for sharing data, streaming voice and video, as well as sending files and events between friends. The goal of QEP2P is to wrap all the instant functionality within Satellite into one convenient place and avoid the limitations modern browsers put on P2P connections.
